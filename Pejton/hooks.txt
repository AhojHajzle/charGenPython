raised by wolves in the frozen north  
trained as an assassin but left the order  
once a noble, now a wandering outcast  
the last survivor of a forgotten kingdom  
cursed by an ancient sorcerer  
betrayed by my closest friend  
the heir to a throne I never wanted  
tasked with guarding a dangerous secret  
hunted by those who know what I truly am  
the lone witness to a crime that changed everything  
gifted with visions of the future  
seeking revenge for my fallen kin  
bound by a blood oath I can’t break  
carrying a map to a lost treasure  
chosen by the gods for a purpose unknown to me  
the only one who escaped the massacre  
a former knight stripped of my honor  
tied to a prophecy I don’t understand  
wandering in search of my missing sibling  
the sole guardian of an ancient relic  
once a scholar, now a fugitive  
haunted by the ghosts of my past  
a mercenary with a debt I can’t repay  
the result of a forbidden experiment  
exiled from my homeland for a crime I didn't commit  
searching for the key to unlocking my true power  
hiding from an enemy who never sleeps  
the last practitioner of a dying art  
a sailor cursed to wander the seas forever  
marked by a demon's touch  
seeking the one who left me for dead  
once a priest, now an apostate  
the unwitting pawn in a cosmic game  
born under a blood moon, said to bring ruin  
the only one who can open a long-sealed door  
running from a deal I made in desperation  
a former war hero, now forgotten  
the owner of a blade that whispers secrets  
a thief who stole something more valuable than gold  
the child of two warring factions  
a healer who can never heal my own wounds  
once a prisoner, now a shadow in the night  
a bard who sings songs only I can remember  
pursued for a crime I can’t recall committing  
a mage whose magic is slowly killing me  
the sole survivor of an airship disaster  
bound by fate to someone I’ve never met  
one of many clones, searching for the original  
a warrior who swore never to lift a blade again  
a researcher on the verge of a world-changing discovery  
the only one who knows how the world will end
